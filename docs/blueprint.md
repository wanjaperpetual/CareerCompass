## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted blue (#6699CC) to inspire confidence and trust. It is inviting without being too overwhelming, suggesting stability.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, creating a clean and professional look, which allows the blue primary to 'pop.'
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9966CC) complements the blue and adds a touch of creativity. Since purple sits next to blue on the color wheel, and the two share some red-like characteristics, this choice offers an unexpected, engaging accent.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, giving a modern, objective, neutral feel and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing warmth and personality.
